an application where we can update and store all the information
client application: https://isharma-sharma.github.io/car-booking-front/
api repository :https://github.com/isharma-sharma/car-booking-back
deployed api: https://car-booking.herokuapp.com/
front-end repository :https://github.com/isharma-sharma/car-booking-front

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
The front end of this application was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript for page structure and formatting. jQuery and AJAX were used to communicate with the back end. I chose this setup because jQuery and javascript explicitly communicate every action to the server, giving me more control over the events on the page. The timer is built entirely with javascript and jQuery, and the Tea Time animation is CSS

General Approach:

I came up with this idea because I wanted to build an application that was simple but useful. I love cars and I am sure this application will be useful to those who  wants to deal with second-hand cars  selling stuff as they need to have their cars always in the working conditon. I began the project working on the back end, creating a resource for cars with the relationship users.

Once the API was set up, I began constructing the client application. First I did all authorization actions, allowing a user to sign-up/in/out/change-password. Next I built a table for the cars to store their collection. I decided that a table would look nicer and more organized than a long list of cars. I then added all the necessary code for a user to fully CRUD on the cars table.

   Next, I wanted to experiment with CSS, so I made an animated message to alert the user for the action they did was successful or not . Finally, I finished with general styling and bug fixes.
